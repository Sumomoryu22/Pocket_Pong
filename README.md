# Pocket_Pong

Elevator pitch

So, you're a stressed out college student looking for a way to boost your energy in between lectures, meeting up with friends, and studying for hours upon end at the library. But you only have 5 minutes, open up facebook, scroll on a few more reels, or check your latest drainng notifications. Or, you can distract yourself and recharge your brain with the classic video game of all, Pong, Pocket Edition, works on a phone and any puter with a connection. 

HTML - This web application is going to have three pages, the first as the initial loadup page which will be simple and have the starting menu where you can create your name, and then the page with the gaming animation, and a final page with a a record of your high score and rankings. 

CSS - I could use CSS to color the first page with retro looking 8-bit graphics, and I could color the last page. 

React - I would use this function for a user to login with their username so they could have a mini AI that will send them messages based on their name and what their high schore was from the last time that they played.
